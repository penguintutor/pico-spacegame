# pico-spacegame
A graphical game created in micropython for the Raspberry Pi Pico with Pico Explorer

The game is implemented by creating a simple class structure similar to the Pygame Zero framework. 

The game is a simple space shooter game based on a game I created in Pygame Zero. This was created for my book "Learn Game Programming with Pygame Zero". http://www.penguintutor.com/projects/book-pygamezero 

This version is simplified to make it work on the Raspberry Pi Pico with the Pico Explorer.
